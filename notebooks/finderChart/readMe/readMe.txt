Hello there! My name is Diego and welcome to my finder chart program.

In order to use this program, enter the Object IDs that you want to look up
into the listOfIds.txt file, with a new line inbetween each object ID (there's
an example in the listOfIds.txt). The PDFs you requested will pop up in the 
results folder.

In the requirements.txt file, there are the 2 packages needed, on top of python,
to run the program. If you don't have those packages installed already, simply 
enter "python3 -m pip install -r readMe/requirements.txt" into your terminal if you are 
running linux, or whatever the equivalent pip command is for your operating system.

If you have any questions or if you have any suggestions to make the program better, 
please email me at diegomartinez91342@gmail.com and I will get to you as soon as I can.

Thank you for your time!
