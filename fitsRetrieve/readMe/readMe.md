Hello there! My name is Diego and welcome to my FITS retrival program.

In the requirements.txt file, there are the 2 packages needed, on top of python,
to run the program. If you don't have those packages installed already, simply 
enter "python3 -m pip install -r readMe/requirements.txt" into your terminal if you are 
running linux, or whatever the equivalent pip command is for your operating system.

If you are using this program to grab specific FITS files, please enter the object ID 
of each star, with a new line in between each ID and follow the prompts. Resulting links
will appear in the 'websites.txt' file, and if you chose to download the files as well
then they will appear in the 'results' folder. THE 'websites.txt' FILE WILL RESET ON
EVERY RUN. If you want to keep those links, please copy it else where.

If you have any questions or if you have any suggestions to make the program better, 
please email me at diegomartinez91342@gmail.com and I will get to you as soon as I can.

Thank you for your time!
